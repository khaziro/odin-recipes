    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Â½ cups self-rising flour, plus more for kneading</li>
      <li>1 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C).</li>
      <li>
        Mix flour and Greek yogurt together in a bowl to form a dough; transfer
        to a work surface floured with self-rising flour. Knead dough, adding
        more flour as needed to keep dough from being too sticky, about 8 to 10
        minutes.
